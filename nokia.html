            <h2 class="featurette-heading">1. Nokia 9 PureView. <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">The Nokia 9 PureView is Nokia's most recent flagship phone, and it comes with cutting-edge features to match. In particular, it comes with one important feature (or five depending on how you count it) in the form of its five-sensor rear camera, which is the most we've seen in a smartphone.

              It's not exactly an expensive phone either, compared to some of the flagships you can buy today, so if you want a photographic smartphone powerhouse without taking a chunk out of your bank account, this may be the phone for you.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">2. Nokia 8.3 5G <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">The Nokia 8.3 5G offers some strong specs for the price with a large 6.81-inch display that's ideal for watching movies while on the move or playing games. With a chunky battery lfe, it'll last you all day too, even if you are enjoying that extra screen space to its fullest. 

              There's a dedicated Google Assistant button that invariably gets in the way and proves annoying, but otherwise, the Nokia 8.3 5G is reasonably well designed if unremarkable looking. Similarly, while the camera setup sounds impressive on paper, the macro sensor is rather mediocre so we wouldn't recommend this one for avid photographers.</p>

          <div class="col-md-7">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">3. Nokia 6.1<span class="text-muted">.</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">While the Nokia 6.1 doesn't quite have all the bells and whistles of the other Nokia handsets above, it's still a great device – especially given many of the downsides we could attribute to it wouldn’t realistically be expected on a phone of its price.

              It's a tough device with a robust design and strong frame – fans of solid and secure phones will love the Nokia 6.1's durability.
              
              It also packs some pretty impressive specs for its low price, with a competent chipset and splendid screen – yet its camera loadout isn't as impressive as it could be.</p>
